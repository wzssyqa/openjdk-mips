//----------OS-DEPENDENT ENCODING BLOCK----------------------------------------
// This block specifies the encoding classes used by the compiler to
// output byte streams.  Encoding classes generate functions which are
// called by Machine Instruction Nodes in order to generate the bit
// encoding of the instruction.  Operands specify their base encoding
// interface with the interface keyword.  There are currently
// supported four interfaces, REG_INTER, CONST_INTER, MEMORY_INTER, &
// COND_INTER.  REG_INTER causes an operand to generate a function
// which returns its register number when queried.  CONST_INTER causes
// an operand to generate a function which returns the value of the
// constant when queried.  MEMORY_INTER causes an operand to generate
// four functions which return the Base Register, the Index Register,
// the Scale Value, and the Offset Value of the operand when queried.
// COND_INTER causes an operand to generate six functions which return
// the encoding code (ie - encoding bits for the instruction)
// associated with each basic boolean condition for a conditional
// instruction.  Instructions specify two basic values for encoding.
// They use the ins_encode keyword to specify their encoding class
// (which must be one of the class names specified in the encoding
// block), and they use the opcode keyword to specify, in order, their
// primary, secondary, and tertiary opcode.  Only the opcode sections
// which a particular instruction needs for encoding need to be
// specified.
